1.	fix the cpp09 ex01 problem: the operations should start at the next operator
2.	verify everything by someone before correction
3.	fix the FillLibn function, taking in account, the level, the j_number, and if 
	there is numbers left in the pend.
4.	Fix the second while loop in insert, in order to be able to identify the levels
	and j_number. It should enter only twice in j_number 3, 2 times in j_number 5,
	and it should be able to recognize if there is still numbers left in the pend
